							<h4>Mercy vs. Grace</h4>
							<p>Grace has been widely understood as "undeserved favor". While this is true, it's only half true because grace is also "the operational power of God". In fact, if you replace "grace" with "the power of God" in every scripture then you get a much better picture of the true meaning of what is being said.</p>
							<p>Kris Vallotton has an analogy for explaining mercy and grace that I love:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>If you were pulled over for speeding and the police officer didn't give you a ticket, that would be mercy: not receiving what you deserved. If you were pulled over for speeding and the police officer gave you $500, that would be grace: receiving what you don't deserve.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Why should you care? That's easy. The truth of the Gospel is that a permanent Mercy Seat was established through the death of Jesus but the POWER OF GOD was poured out on you because of His resurrection. If you understand grace as the power of God, then you can read through scripture and realize that there's more power available. However, if you understand grace as forgiveness, then you read the scripture thinking that you need more forgiveness because somehow the cross just wasn't enough.</p>
									
									<h4>Mercy Over Judgement</h4>
									<p>In Matthew 9:13, Jesus quotes the book of Hosea and says: "Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not judgement'". My translation says "I desire compassion, not sacrifice". Jesus was talking to the Pharisees when He quoted this and was speaking to a common theme we find in every conversation He has with them: the Pharisees were focused on the letter of the Law while Jesus was focused on the heart.</p>
									<p>Why did He quote Hosea? Jesus referred to the beautiful story of Hosea and Gomer because He was declaring what was about to come - and reminding the Pharisees of the prophecies that were spoken of in the past.</p>
									<p>Hosea is a story of the prophet Hosea and his wife, Gomer. God tells Hosea to marry a prostitute named Gomer and he obeys. They have kids together but then Gomer suddenly runs off and goes back into the life she knew before. Rather than divorcing her (which the Law gave him the right to do because of her adultery), God tells Hosea to find her and bring her home. So Hosea sets off to hit the streets in a desperate search for his wife. Can you imagine? He set off on this search knowing the high probability of him finding her in bed with another man. After he restores her, God speaks through Hosea and declares the words: "I desire mercy, not judgement".</p>
									<p>Through the eyes of MERCY, we see the restoration of our souls...but it's not until we look through the eyes of GRACE that we begin to uncover the rest of the message.</p>
									 
									<h4>Grace And Truth</h4>
									<blockquote>
									<p>“For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.”</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Knowing that Grace is not forgiveness but power, we could rephrase this to say:</p>
									<blockquote>
									<p>"but the power of God and truth came through Jesus Christ".</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Jesus is the word of God and He manifested the truth of God's word by taking on flesh ( truth ). When Jesus was baptized in the Jordan, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in power ( grace ). He brought the Kingdom to earth while teaching on the Kingdom and elevating love over law. Actually, when asked what is the greatest commandment, He answered:</p>
									<blockquote>
									<p>You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>He furthers His point again in John 14:15:</p>
									<blockquote>
									<p>If you love Me, you will keep My commandments</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>In John 16:13, Jesus said “But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth.” Jesus came in grace and truth because <strong>Grace empowers us to walk out what truth reveals</strong>.</p>
									<p>We find that the commandments of the Law were done away with because of the priesthood transition (Hebrews 7) and we're left with a commandment that "sums up the Law and the prophets". We understand that the original commandments were artifacts of the Mosaic Covenant (written on tablets of stone); however, we often forget that this new commandment from Jesus is an artifact of our new covenant with Him.</p>
									
									<h4>Covenant Relationships</h4>
									<p>Back in the beginning, back before anything ever went wrong, Adam was in the image of God. He was created in the image of God AND in the fullness of God. He was righteous. He was holy. He was in perfect standing with God and he did NOT have a sinful nature. The “desires of the flesh” (as we understand after the fall) didn’t exist. Understanding that context, let’s take a look at Adam again.</p>
									<p>In Genesis 2:18 it says:  Then the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.”</p>
									<p>We’ve commonly understood this story to indicate that Adam was lonely or meditating on “desires of the flesh”. However, we see that God Himself is the one that noticed what was missing - not Adam. I believe that God made this profound statement because without a “helper”, the revelation of God inside of Adam couldn’t be reproduced. He could never fulfill the command to “be fruitful and multiply”.</p>
									<p>The creation of Eve is the first example we have of the beauty of intimacy with the Father. He creates Eve out of Adam - out of the FULLNESS and the intimacy God had with Adam, He created Eve. This models a profound spiritual principle:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
										<p>Intimacy (unity) in the spirit always gives birth to something in the physical.</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									
									<h4>A Better Covenant</h4>
									<p>Have you ever been to a wedding and watched the groom when the bride enters the room? It’s such a sweet moment to watch the groom fill with tears. Paul writes to the church in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 11:2:</p>
									<blockquote>
									<p>for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>This is a BRILLIANT revelation of our relationship with Jesus! We’ve become Holy and Righteous and we’re presented to Jesus as His bride. We’re presented as one as if we’ve never been with the world. That’s the beauty of being brought into righteousness: Jesus’ perpetual view of us is a groom standing waiting for his bride.</p>
									<p>Do you remember when God said that it wasn’t good for man to be alone? He said “I will make a HELPER suitable for for him.” When Jesus promises the Holy Spirit in John 14:16, He says “I am sending you another, a HELPER”. It’s no coincidence that He echoed the words of the Father.</p>
									<p>Jesus echoed this once again in His High Priestly Prayer in John 17 where He said that we would be one with Him as they are one. Jesus wants our relationship with God to be the same that He has with the Father! This is why when Jesus said “the Father” and not Heaven when He said in John 14:6:  “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me”.</p>
									<p>When we said yes to Jesus, that was us saying “I do” at our wedding!</p>
									
									<h4>Mary: A Model Of Christianity</h4>
									<p>Have you ever really thought about the birth of Jesus? How did Mary actually get pregnant? Let’s look back at the spiritual principle we found when looking at Adam and Eve:</p>
									
									Intimacy (unity) in the spirit always gives birth to something in the physical.
									
									<p>Mary models this principle not once, but twice!</p>
									<p>The first time we see the principle in action with her is with the birth of Jesus. She becomes pregnant with Jesus through the Holy Spirit (through unity in the spirit). Then she physically gives birth to the savior of the world! As we fast forward to the Wedding of Cana, we find that Mary provides a beautiful illustration for the expectancy that you and I should carry with us everywhere that we go.</p>
									<p>In John 5:19, Jesus says:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>Jesus got all of His orders from the Father. In fact, Jesus hadn’t performed a single miracle before the Wedding of Cana. That’s what makes this such an interesting story. Let’s take a look at John 2:1-7:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;    and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.   When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, “They have no wine.”   And Jesus *said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come.”    His mother *said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”    Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.  J  esus *said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>I used to think that Jesus was rebuking Mary but now I’ve come to understand that Jesus didn’t have “clearance” to perform any miracles yet. His response to Mary was that “my hour has not yet come”. Rather than backing down, Mary gets bolder! “Whatever He says to you, do it”. Jesus must’ve received different orders after this because He turns around and performs His first miracle. So what happened?</p>
									<p>MARY CHANGED GOD’S MIND.</p>
									<p>God is looking for people that will partner with Him. He’s looking for people that are so PREGNANT WITH ANTICIPATION that they can’t help but manifest His glory everywhere they go! Mary had given birth to Jesus in the physical world but she hadn’t yet given birth to the Messiah. Mary modeled the very nature of Christianity at that wedding! Jesus was the word of God made flesh and you and are I called to manifest the Father everywhere we go!</p>
									
									<h4>Intimacy And Spiritual Warfare</h4>
									<p>As I mentioned before, Paul says that we have presented to Christ in marriage. We are betrothed to one Husband and He sees us as if we’ve never been with the world. What a beautiful relationship we have with our Savior!</p>
									<p>This isn’t a new analogy. We know that there are many scriptures speaking of the church being the bride of Christ. The beautiful thing about this picture is that it’s for both the body of Christ as well as the individual. Let’s take a look at one of those most popular scriptures that makes this comparison in Ephesians 5:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,   so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,   because we are members of His body.   For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.  T  his mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.   Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>When I married my wife, I didn’t marry her because I need her to love me. I married her because I committed to loving her with the same unconditional love that Christ has for me. That means that my love is not dependent on what she does for me or what I need from her; I love her because I’ve laid down my life to serve her. Likewise, she didn’t marry me only to receive love. She married me because she committed to doing the same.</p>
									
									<p>Marriage is a covenant relationship and it’s through this covenant that God gives us the closest representation that we have of our relationship with Him: sex. Satan has always wanted to distort the very thing that was designed to bring us into awareness of the intimacy we’re supposed to have with the Father. You wouldn’t counterfeit a dollar bill, would you? But you would a hundred dollar bill! The devil went for the most beautiful thing that God created and has worked tirelessly to distort it.</p>
									<p>We see a distortion of intimacy in the first view of Adam and Eve after their sin by them covering their naked bodies. Why? It says “because they became aware of their nakedness”. They became aware of their vulnerability with the Father!</p>
									<p>When husband and wife come together, there’s a unity of flesh and spirit that is the best example we have of intimacy because it involves the physical, emotional, and spiritual realms all at once. Because there is intimacy (unity) in the spiritual realm, that’s why we see conception and birth happen in the physical realm.</p>
									<p>What if submission to one another in marriage through physical, emotional, and spiritual intimacy is an example of our submission to God?</p>
									<p>When Jesus was illustrating love over law, He said:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery’;   but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:27-28)</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>We are married to God. If we lust in our hearts of the desires of this world, we are committed adultery against our spouse! This is why Jesus said “If you love me, keep my commandments”. He wasn’t saying “if you love me, you will keep these rules”. He was saying, “if you love me, you’ll stay faithful to me!”</p>
									<p>When we view submission to God in this light, this famous very starts to make more sense:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>If someone is bound and determined to try and seduce me, they’re going to get frustrated and give up if they continue to find me submitted, committed, loyal, sold out, and IN LOVE with my wife. If I’m madly in love with my wife, I should be madly in love with her when no one else is around!</p>
									<p>The Bible doesn’t say to submit to God when the devil comes to mess with you; it says to submit therefore to God because:</p>
									
									<blockquote>
									<p>Submission to God is how we resist the devil.</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>When the devil comes to tempt us and he finds us submitted to God, he flees! Then he comes back, finds us STILL submitted, still in love, still on fire, and he flees again!</p>
									
									<h4>Intimacy As A Lifestyle</h4>
									<p>Have you ever wondered why God chose to call them “fruit of the Spirit”? When we discovered our identity, we realize that God has actually brought us into the Garden. He changed the tree to make it possible to create the fruit of the Spirit rather than the fruit of the flesh (the world). However, fruit doesn’t magically appear without conception and conception doesn’t happen without intimacy. If we want to see the fruit of the Spirit in our lives, we must have intimacy with the Father!</p<
									<p>We see in Proverbs 9:10:</p>
									<blockquote>
									<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</p>
									</blockquote>
									
									<p>I used to think that the fear of the Lord was an actual fear. I heard a Pastor recently define it instead as “a deep and reverential sense of accountability to God”. My spirit immediately leapt and screamed “that’s an awareness of your marriage to God!” The fear of the Lord is INTIMACY!</p>
									<p>We know that intimacy/unity in the Spirit always gives birth to something in the physical. This is why God says that where there is unity, He COMMANDS a blessing. It’s also why when we delight in the Lord (align our hearts with His), He gives us the desires of our heart. In order to give birth to the breakthrough that you’re seeking, you must find yourself in a place of intimacy with Him.</p>
									<p>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. If God is Spirit, then we experience the greatest freedom when we live in intimacy and communion with Him! Freedom is a byproduct of intimacy. And just like intimacy with a spouse, intimacy with the Lord is designed to impact the physical and emotional areas of your life as well.</p<
									<p>I believe that in the process of desensitizing our society to abortions and distorting the very nature of sex, the enemy has also blinded us to the fact that he’s also done the very same thing on a spiritual level. If he can prevent you from being intimate with the Father, then you’ll never conceive the dreams that God has for; but if you do conceive the dream or the breakthrough, the enemy will do anything he can to abort what’s inside of you before you birth it.</p>
									<p>It’s during the waiting period of conception to birth that the enemy comes to steal, kill, and destroy through discouragement. The world says “don’t get your hopes up”. That’s the voice of the stranger telling you to take your eyes off of Jesus, the author and perfecter of your faith. The Father’s voice says that Christ in you, the HOPE OF GLORY. He also says that “but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.”</p>
									<p>GET YOUR HOPES UP! Stop listening to the stranger’s voice and focus on the voice of the one who created you to destroy the works of the devil. Live in intimacy with your Father so that you can step into the Spirit of wisdom and understanding that has been allotted to you.</p>

									<h4>Your Destiny</h4>
									<p>Your destiny isn't a position, a title, a career, or even a "goal". Your destiny isn't found in answering what/where. Your destiny is found in WHO. Until we learn how to receive God's love, we'll never truly love ourselves. It's only THEN that we can truly love one another!</p>
