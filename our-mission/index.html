			<p>We've been trained by a lie and lived beneath our potential for too long. In this lesson, you are going to learn:

					<li>1. You're designed to live free from offense and the emotions of the world</li>
					<li>2. The simplicity of the gospel</li>
					<li>3. The freedom you were destined for</li>

					<blockquote>
						<p>God is love.</p>
						<p>- 1 John 4:8</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [d]for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love</p>
						<p>- 1 John 4:15-18</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>It's all so simple! God is love. We were made for HIS image (the image of love). Adam and Eve were made in the image of love but then they fell and became in NEED of love. The cross was the redemptive plan to bring us back into love so that as he is, so are we in this world.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</p>
						<p>- 1 Timothy 1:5</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>The goal of our instruction is love! Love doesn’t seek its own (1 Cor 13). Love is selfless! So 1 Corinthians 13 is a description of what we’re supposed to BECOME.</p>

					<p>That means that the only way you can be bitter, angry, jealous, or offended is if you make this life about YOU. Jesus said that if we are to follow Him we must first DENY OURSELVES. We're literally called to deny ourselves and DIE. If we've denied our rights and died to sin, why do we get offended when someone violates a right that we denied?
						The goal in this life is not that you be loved by people or even by God. The goal is that we BECOME the love of God. The purpose of the cross isn't "God loves you!" The purpose of the cross is that you become the love that loves you!
					</p>

					<p>Jesus did everything on this earth as a man through agency of Holy Spirit - the same Spirit that lives in YOU. His attitude and the miracles all flowed out of a wellspring of love - the same love that you and I are called to become. Our attitudes and our responses should reflect the love that we are becoming.</p>

					<p>We can do this. We can become the royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:5) that He dreamt about. We can become the people that loves like He loves and changes this world. We can set our eyes on things above and not beneath (Colossians 3) and we can step into our inheritance and reign in this life as Kings (Romans 5:17).</p>

					<p>The question is: will you simply believe that you are free?</p>

			<h2>3. DISCUSS</h2>
			<p>Feel free to use the following as conversation starters with your group (or come up with your own!):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1. How are you going to pursue this freedom?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3b. ACTIVATION</h2>
			<p>Spend time in prayer with God. Thank Him for opening your heart to truth and ask Him for the grace to become what your eyes have seen. Ask Him for deeper revelation. Ask Him for an encounter that will transform your life.</p>
