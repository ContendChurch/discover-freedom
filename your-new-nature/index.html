					<p>
						Prior to our life in Christ, we were trained by a lie. Our mind, our will, and our emotions were set on the things of this world but we've been born again and now we have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). In this lesson, you are going to learn:

						<ul>
							<li>1. The truth of your new nature in Christ</li>
							<li>2. The lies that the enemy has used to prevent you from reaching your full potential in Christ</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p><em>In each lesson, there is a short video, some light reading where we pair the "big picture" with scripture, and then discussion questions for your group.</em></p>

						<p>As we learned in our previous lesson, Adam and Eve fell out of the image of God when they ate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The devil persuaded them into questioning God and becoming gods to themselves (Genesis 3:5). They fell out of the image of God (love) and into the image of sin (self-seeking, envy, lustful, hate, etc.) (Galatians 5:19-21). From then on, mankind has been born of Adam; born of the fallen image of man and not the original image that God had intended for humanity (Romans 5:12).</p>

<p>When we are reborn, we become dead to sin and we are resurrected into the likeness of God (John 3:3, Romans 6:11, Colossians 3:10). As we behold the image who we are created to be like, we are transformed into the same image (2 Corinthians 3:18). Paul writes in 2 Corinthians:</p>
<blockquote>
	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. (2 Corinthians 5:17)
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the good news of the gospel is so good and so simple that we can boil it down to say:</p>

<blockquote class="kingdom-principle">
		<p>In our new nature, we are no longer inherently sinful</p>
	</blockquote>


<p>How do we know that? Let's continue reading in 2 Corinthians 5. Paul concludes this famous passage with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (v21)
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus BECAME sin so that we might become the righteousness of God. Paul also wrote to the romans that we should consider ourselves DEAD to sin. He echoes this again in Colossians 2 and 3. So why do we get tripped up on the idea that we're saints rather than sinners?</p>

<p>The most conflicting passage is found in Romans 7:13-24. Paul begins to discuss this conflict of two natures and it's commonly understood that it's a problem that he's currently struggling with. However, rather than it being a current struggle, Paul is employing a literary device known as "historical present" to emphasize a point. He is reminiscing about his pre-Christian life when he struggled to keep the law apart from the power of Grace. </p>

<p>Grace has been widely understood as "undeserved favor". We recently began teaching that while this is true, it's only half true because grace is also "the operational power of God". In fact, if you replace "grace" with "the power of God" in every scripture then you get a much better picture of the true meaning of what is being said.</p>

<p>Kris Vallotton has an analogy for explaining mercy and grace that I love:</p>
<blockquote>
	If you were pulled over for speeding and the police officer didn't give you a ticket, that would be mercy: not receiving what you deserved. If you were pulled over for speeding and the police officer gave you $500, that would be grace: receiving what you don't deserve.
</blockquote>

<p>Why should you care? That's easy. The truth of the Gospel is that a permanent Mercy Seat was established through the death of Jesus but the POWER OF GOD was poured out on you because of His resurrection. If you understand grace as the power of God, then you can read through scripture and realize that there's more power available. However, if you understand grace as forgiveness, then you read the scripture thinking that you need more forgiveness because somehow the cross just wasn't enough.</p>

<p>It's through grace that we become empowered to walk out what truth reveals to us. We're not longer under the power of sin. Jesus cursed sin in the flesh and stripped it of its power. Now, you and I get to live a life of holiness, righteousness, and being set apart for the Father. Jesus never tried to sin and get away with it! Grace isn't a license to sin; it's the power to live free from it. In your new nature, you now have the power to overcome.</p>

					<h2>3. DISCUSS</h2>
					<p>Feel free to use the following as conversation starters with your group (or come up with your own!):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1. If we no longer have a sinful nature, that means we no longer HAVE to sin; it's a choice that we make. How does that change your perspective?</li>
						<li>2. Do you think it's possible to live a life that's free from sin?</li>
						<li>3. What are implications of being born again if we were originally "born of Adam"?</li>
