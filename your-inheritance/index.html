					<p>
						What if we've totally misunderstood the Kingdom of God? What if we've lived under a shadow of what God truly intended for us? In this lesson, you will learn:

						<ul>
							<li>1. The inheritance that Jesus paid for with His life to give you</li>
							<li>2. The perspective that God has called you to live from</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p><em>In each lesson, there is a short video, some light reading where we pair the "big picture" with scripture, and then discussion questions for your group.</em></p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17)</p>
						</blockquote>
						
						<blockquote>
							<p>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. (Romans 8:1-8)</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!” 16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him. (Romans 8:14-17)</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p><em>(You should really just read all of Romans. It's AMAZING.)</em></p>
						
						<p>We are heirs of God! The Kingdom of His beloved son, the Kingdom which we've been transferred into (Colossians 1:13-14), IS part our inheritance. We now live in the Kingdom of God so our focus is no longer earth itself but rather our rightful position with God (Colossians 3:1-3). The King's domain is what we live from and what we carry. We are called to reign with Him as Kings (2 Timothy 2:12). What an incredible calling!</p>

						<p>When we have this perspective, perhaps the words of Jesus in Luke 11 will have a bigger impact:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

									“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (Luke 11:9-13)</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>My prayer for you in this lesson is that you would awaken to the inheritance that is already provided for you. I pray that you wouldn't ask for what's already been given but that you would receive, by faith, what has already been paid for.</p>

						<li>1. What does the Kingdom of God mean to you?</li>
						<li>2. Share what the Lord is revealing to you. What questions have risen in our heart? Have you had any "ah ha" moments?</li>
