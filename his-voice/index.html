							<h4>EMBRACING GRACE</h4>
<p>Love isn’t just an attribute that we use to describe God; God IS love. It’s who He is and it’s impossible for Him to act outside of His nature. The gifts of the Spirit are some of God’s love languages; they’re how He often uses us to show His love to others in supernatural ways. </p>

<p>Paul lists 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12:8-11
<blockquote>
    <p>For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this letter, Paul is addressing the Corinthians because they just don’t quite “get it” yet. During this time, they are arguably some of the most spiritual people you’d meet but they have no idea who God really is. They’ve been heavily influenced through Greek mythology and gravitate towards the belief that there are multiple Gods. When Paul says “but the same Spirit”, he is repeating himself over and over so that the Corinthians (who were influenced by Greek mythology and used to worshipping multiple gods) understand that’s it the SAME God (rather than a God of healing, a God of prophecy, etc.). Rather than listing out this all inclusive list of how God operates, Paul was simply redirecting their understanding and introducing them to the spirit realm.</p>

<p>In Chapter 14, verse 1 Paul says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are to earnestly desire spiritual gifts. Earnestly desire means to “lust after”. That means that God wants us to pursue His gifts! He is a good father that desires to give us His gifts even more than we could ever want them. Knowing what we know now, let’s discuss three important facts that we must recognize about the gifts of the Spirit:</p>

<h4>1. YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE GIFTS</h4>
<p>You are a temple and a host of the Holy Spirit. You have access to all of the gifts because the Giver lives inside of you! While some may gravitate towards certain gifts (e.g., prophecy, healing), you still have access to all of them. The Holy Spirit simply distributes them when needed. </p>

<h4>2. GIFTINGS DO NOT IMPLY MATURITY</h4>
<p>Gifts of the Spirit do not validate our walk with God. Because the gifts are given to everyone, they cannot be used as the measuring stick for spiritual maturity. The fruit of the Spirit is developed as a person matures in Christ as they allow the Holy Spirit to work IN them, not just THROUGH them.</p>

<h4>3. GIFTS ARE NOT EARNED</h4>
<p>Gifts of the Spirit are not awards just as salvation isn’t a reward for a job well done. Grace is both undeserved favor and the operational power of God. The gifts of the Spirit are given through grace, through the operational power of God that is resting on you.</p>

<p>Christians are notorious for being “pendulum swingers”. When we learn more about the gifts, we tend to favor those over fruit. If we’ve been “burned by the gifts”, we tend to favor the fruit over the gifts. The truth is that Paul gave us a very clear command to “pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy” (1 Corinthians 14:1). It’s the will of God for each of us to grow in love, character, and power.</p>

<p>There are four gifts of the Spirit that make up the “revelatory gifts”: 1) word of knowledge 2) word of wisdom 3) discerning of spirits and 4) the gift of prophecy. </p>


<h4>PROPHETIC GIFTS</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer. Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come. 2 Corinthians 5:16-17</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are new creations. Our old nature tends towards sensuality but when Jesus redeemed you, He redeemed ALL of you (body, mind, and spirit). </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. ‭Ephesians‬ ‭4:19-24‬</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that your senses now tend towards sensitivity to the spirit realm. When we put all of the pieces together, we learn that we are no longer physical beings having an occasional spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings that are temporarily having a physical experience.</p>

<p>We have to reach a place where we decide that we refuse to believe that we can’t hear from God because that belief is rooted in a lie! The Old Covenant veiled God’s heart and TRUE nature from His people. One way that happened was Him only being able to speak through Prophets to the people. We are now living in the New Covenant. We are temples of the Holy Spirit and we have direct access to God all day every day! The question is no longer CAN we hear from God; the question now is HOW do we hear from God?</p>

<p>People are struggling and secretly crying out for encouragement. They don't need help identifying their sins. We're all good at that! It doesn't take the supernatural to point out someone's failures but it does take the prophetic gifts to find the gold in people. That is the purpose of prophetic ministry.</p>

<p>Prophecy includes the spiritual gifts of a word of knowledge, word of wisdom, discerning of spirits, and the gift of prophecy. </p>

<p>A prophetic word has three primary components:</p>

<h4>1. REVELATION</h4>
<p>Revelation is knowledge or information we could not have known unless God revealed it to us. It can come as a dream, a vision, an impression, or a knowing. It is basically the “what did you see, hear, or perceive?” portion of a prophetic word.</p>

<p>Do you remember the story of the prophet Samuel? We see in 1 Samuel 3 that Samuel was asleep and the Lord called to him in an audible voice. Samuel runs to Eli and says “Here I am, you called me”. Eli tells him to go back to sleep because he didn’t call him. This happens three times! On the third time, Eli is a little more awake and realizes that God must be speaking to Samuel so he tells him, “if He does it again, tell Him ‘here I am Lord, I’m listening’”.</p>

<p>We learn one of the greatest lessons about hearing God from this story. We are so supernatural that sometimes the SUPER sounds NATURAL to us. God’s voice often sounds a lot like YOU.</p>

<h4>2. INTERPRETATION</h4>
<p>Once we perceive a revelation, we then move into interpretation. When God speaks through us, He’s smart enough to factor in our “accent”. This means that the word will be filtered through our own experiences, the teaching we have received, our ethnic culture, our gender, etc. These ingredients inevitably flavor the word.</p>

<h4>3. APPLICATION</h4>
<p>Application is the “what do we do with this” portion of the prophecy. Many times, the application is not our job. Rather, it is left to the person receiving the word to determine what he or she is supposed to do as a result of the prophetic word.</p>

<p>One question you might have is, "what are the differences between the four prophetic gifts?" Let’s touch briefly on how each of these works:</p>

<h5>WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</h5>
<p>A word of knowledge is a specific fact about a person, place, or event that was not obtained through natural means. It generally contains no directional guidance, just facts or information, hence its name - a word of knowledge.</p>

<p>Often times, words of knowledge in action can look like feeling pain when God wants to heal someone. You can then use that as a conversation starter. “Hey does your knee hurt? It does?! Well can I pray for it, God told me He wants to heal it!” </p>

<h5>WORD OF WISDOM</h5>
<p>A word of wisdom is a divine revelation of the will, plan, or purpose of God for a specific situation. It differs from a word of knowledge in several ways. A word of wisdom is often directional in nature because it contains prophetic insight on what should be done in a situation. </p>

<p>One of the most practical ways this looks like is in an advice setting. However, you’re NOT giving people your opinions or ideas on what should be done in the matter. Sometimes you may have absolutely no experience in the area you’re counseling someone in. Because it’s not YOU doing the advice giving, but a word of wisdom flowing through you. </p>

<h5>DISCERNING OF SPIRITS</h5>
<p>The word “discern” means “to distinguish between.” The word “spirit” can mean any of the following in Scripture: angels, demons, the human spirit, the Holy Spirit, anointings, mantles, or the motivation influence of a person. Discerning of spirits, then, is the ability to recognize and distinguish between different types of spirits and anointings.</p>


<h5>GIFT OF PROPHECY</h5>
<p>The gift of prophecy is for strengthening, encouragement, and comfort. When we prophesy over someone, that person should feel kissed by God. If we see something negative in someone's life, we need to ask the Holy Spirit to give us the answer to the problem that we're discerning. Then we prophesy the answer - not the problem. The Proverbs 18:21 says</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we prophesy the answer to a negative problem that we discern, we release grace to break bondage and strongholds in the lives of others.</p>

<p>These gifts flow in and out of each other. For example, a word of knowledge helps setup the context for the gift of prophecy. The discerning of spirits gift can help us see a spiritual struggle that someone is dealing with and we can prophesy God's promises over their lives.</p>

<h4>OPERATIONS OF THE GIFTS</h4>
<p>The prophetic gifts tend to take different shapes in different people. You may have noticed that some people “see” while others “hear”. Isn’t it amazing how differently God speaks to all of us? It’s even more amazing it’s the same voice - we just all tend it experience it differently. Let’s discuss this in detail. Hebrews 5:14 says:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word “trained” in the Greek is “gymnázō” which basically means to head to the gym for an intense workout. When Jesus died on the cross, He redeemed our entire body. That means that our senses now act as spiritual indicators for the spirit realm. In order to use them to their full capacity, we need to take our faith to the gym and work out. That means that we need to take some risks and TRY using our gifts!</p>

<p>We all tend to gravitate towards certain gifts. This tends to be our resting position for how we experience the spirit realm. This is the default sensor that we use to pick up on whatever is happening in the spirit. Let’s take a look at two very important things to understand about the spirit realm:</p>

<h4>1. GOD’S VOICE IS MULTI-DIMENSIONAL</h4>
<p>God created time and is therefore not restricted by time (how can you be restricted by what you created?). We also know that God is spirit (John 4:24) and can reason that the spirit realm is also not restricted by time. This means that when we perceive a prophetic word, we not only have to judge the source of the word but we also have to question the WHEN of the word. Is this past information? Is this current? Does this point to the future?</p>

<p>Are you the familiar with sound theory? Since we’re studying the voice of God, it only seems fitting that we understand a little bit about sound! Sound is commonly measured in frequency which is a measurement of the sound waves (vibrations) that are being produced. The interesting thing about frequency (measured in hertz) is that this unit is used to measure everything from sound to gamma rays. The higher up the scale you go, the more the signal begins to change and you go from sound to color, from color to gamma rays, etc.</p>

<p>God’s voice speaks on all frequencies at the same time. We perceive His voice based on the sensors we have setup at different frequencies. These sensors are the operations (the modes of operation) of the prophetic gifts that we currently have activated in our life. Furthermore, those sensors are initialized by a combination of grace and faith. Grace installs the sensor and faith turns it on.</p>

<p>The vibrations of God’s voice register on all frequencies but we do not have sensors installed at every measure of the scale. Furthermore, our sensors are only indicating some of the dimensions that God is speaking in. Our spirits can recognize His voice (John 10:27) even though our mortal minds cannot comprehend the medium in which it’s being communicated.</p>

<h4>2. GOD IS CONSTANTLY SPEAKING</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. (John 1:1-5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the beginning was Jesus, and Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God. If Jesus is the Word of God, then the very life of Jesus is God’s voice personified. That means that as long as Jesus is alive, GOD IS SPEAKING.</p>

<p>Our view of the spirit realm used to look like a bucket of raffle tickets. We would cover our eyes (or look the other way) while we reached into the bucket and pulled out a ticket. That ticket would be some bizarre artifact from the spirit realm that had to be carefully inspected and translated. We could repeat this process until we ran out of tickets. God is ALWAYS speaking and therefore we NEVER run out of the revelation that we can perceive from Him.</p>

<p>We’re not just reaching into the spirit to perceive a revelation; we STEP into the spirit and experience the revelation.</p>

<h4>3. OUR SENSORS IMPROVE WITH USE</h4>
<p>Our sensors are immune to normal wear and tear. They do not degrade over time. In fact, we fine tune them as we use them. It is important to note, however, that the analogy of faith as a muscle is very accurate. Muscle growth eventually plateaus if we don’t increase resistance. When you’re dealing with physical muscles, resistance is measured by weight. When you’re dealing with faith, resistance is measured by risk.</p>

<p>If you exercise your sensor for receiving words of knowledge through feeling, then you physically feel the pain in your body. As you continue to use this sensor, your ability to perceive words of knowledge through it will be extremely accurate but eventually your growth will plateau. To “add weight” to your training, you can begin to ask the Holy Spirit for more specifics (e.g., “what color is the person’s hair? How old are they? What side of the room are they on?”)</p>

<p>Hebrews 5:14 serves as inspiration for us to not grow stale. When we pair it with 1 Corinthians 14:1 (“pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy”), we get an even better picture of how we should view the spirit realm. Not only should we lust after the gifts (God’s love languages), we should be exercising them as often as possible!</p>

<h4>PROPHECY AND SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>As we learn to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit, we must realize that not every voice that speaks to us from the spirit realm is from God.
    Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are God’s beloved but the devil is sneaky in how he interacts with us. If he showed himself in an obvious way, it’d be a lot harder for him to carry out his mission to steal, kill, and destroy. Instead, he often comes as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14) and that we are to be aware of his schemes (2 Corinthians 2:11).</p>

<p>As we experience more and more of the spirit realm, that’s discuss the four sources from the spirit realm that form the voices that we hear:</p>

<h4>1. OUR SPIRIT</h4>
We are a spirit that has a soul and a body. When we are born again, our spirit comes to life making it possible to hear from the spirit realm, but not necessarily hearing from the Holy Spirit. Hearing from our own spirit is still a spiritual experience and being aware of this will help us discern which voice is speaking to us.

<h4>2. THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>
<p>This is God’s Spirit, the one with whom we are building a relationship and learning to hear clearly.</p>

<h4>3. EVIL SPIRITS</h4>
<p>Spirits from the evil realm can speak to Christians just as they spoke to Jesus when He encountered satan in the wilderness.</p>

<h4>4. ANGELS</h4>
<p>According to Hebrews chapter 1, these are spirits sent to render service to the saints. Angels also speak to us about the things of God.</p>

<p>Distinguishing between these four sources comes with experience. You can study all day long but at the end of the day, it comes through trial and error. This means that not only can we potentially be wrong when we deliver a word, the person delivering a word to us could potentially be wrong as well. This is why Paul instructed us to examine every word carefully (1 Thessalonians 5:19-21).</p>

<p>Every word must be judged before we receive it and speak it over ourselves. However, it’s also important to note that we’re called to partner with the word rather than place it on a shelf and wait for it to happen. In the Old Covenant, the Spirit God wasn’t living inside of people and their spirits hadn’t been brought to life. The people didn’t have any way of processing spiritual information so the only thing they could do was just wait for it to come to pass. In the New Covenant, our spirits have been brought from death to life and the Holy Spirit is alive inside of us. We have the ability to process spiritual information, judge the words against the Word of God, AND contend for them!</p>

<p>Prophetic words equip us for warfare! Prophetic ministry actually gives us weapons to defend ourselves against the evil schemes of the enemy. For example, Paul commanded Timothy to revisit the former prophetic words that he had received and use them as weapons during times of assault. Prophetic words remind us of our destiny, confirm our calling, encourage, edify, and comfort us.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. (1 Timothy 1:18-19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re instructed to recall the prophetic words that have been given to us because they help us in our fight. The question you might have is: “how do they help me fight?” Let’s examine spiritual warfare in light of our new knowledge of the prophetic.</p>

<p>The enemy comes to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:1). The word for “steal” means to “steal secretively (by stealth)”. He works to distort the word of God and the truth of God. He also understands the power in prophetic words so his primary target is to rob you of them. This is why it’s so important to actively PARTNER with the words that are spoken over you by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>- Agreeing with the words and accepting them over your life</li>
    <li>- Journaling them or storing them in a place where you can reference them</li>
    <li>- Pray over them and with them</li>
    <li>- Continue to speak them over yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>Ephesians 6 is one of the most famous passages regarding spiritual warfare:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. (Ephesians 6:10-17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s interesting about the sword of the Spirit is that the word used for “word” is “rhema”. Rhema refers to the spoken-word of God and extends to prophecy. All scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16) but rhema is when the Word of God is revealed, applied, and activated. This means that the prophetic words that we receive and continue to speak over ourselves is the sword that we wield!</p>

					<p>Feel free to use the following as conversation starters with your group (or come up with your own!):</p>

						<li>1. When I was growing up, we had this perspective of “anything I don’t know the answer to, I’ll have to wait til I get to Heaven to ask God about it”. Which is SO false. Can you identify any mindsets or lies you’ve believed about hearing God’s voice? What TRUTH has God replaced those with?</li>
