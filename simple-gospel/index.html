						<p>The fall of man started as a love story. Wait, what?! Think about it…God is love! Everything He ever did was because of His reckless love for us. The story of creation is a story of God’s original design for intimacy with us. Don’t believe me? Check out the first few verses of the Bible. Right away we are able to see God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit working together to form something magnificent. This creation would ultimately bring us into a deep, intimate place with the Lord.</p>

						<blockquote>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.” (Genesis 1:1-2)</blockquote>
						<blockquote>“Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground…” (Genesis 1:26)</blockquote>
						<blockquote>“In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.” (John 1:1-3)</blockquote>
								
						<p>God's nature can be found in the garden and all throughout the Old and New Testament. Our identity goes all the way back to the Garden where mankind was created in the likeness of God! His original design for mankind was intimacy with Him.</p>

						<p>Mankind was born into a war. Did you know that? The Garden didn’t cover all of the earth. God's will was to have the earth filled. He told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it.</p>

						<p>When satan came into the garden he didn't have dominion so he deceived Adam and Eve into agreement with Him. To this day we empower him by coming into agreement with lies. Satan made them question God (“did He really say that?”) and then he fed them the lie: “If you eat from the tree, you’ll become like Him”. The truth is that Adam and Eve were ALREADY like Him. They were made in His image!</p>

						<p>By questioning God, Adam and Eve began to question why the tree even existed. Why would He put it there other than to get them into trouble? The truth is that God values love and freedom so much and knew that without the choice the two wouldn’t exist. When Adam and Eve stepped into agreement with the enemy, they empowered Him by partnering with his lie. The enemy tricked them into performance and they immediately felt guilt and shame. They hid! We were never meant to feel guilt and shame. </p>

						<p>We have been created to worship Him because He knows that we become like what we worship. When we come into agreement with lies we worship the world and, in time, become like the world. Are we finding our identity in God, or in the world? In the kingdom of God, our identity shapes everything and it is crucial that we find ourselves in the image of God and not that of a fallen a world.</p>

						<p>The truth is that when we say YES to Jesus, He makes us justified, just as if we never sinned, just as if we never ate of the tree. We become REBORN. We become REFATHERED. We’re no longer found in the fallen image of Adam but we’re reborn into the image of God. We’re made in HIS image! We can’t overstate this because:</p>

						<blockquote class="kingdom-principle">
							<p>Image Informs Identity</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Our identity tells us that we’re back in the garden (Kingdom) and we’ve been commissioned with the same mandate: to be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it.</p>
