					<h4>A Shift In Thinking</h4>

					<br />
					<blockquote>
						<p>Six days later Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!” When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground and were terrified. And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, “Get up, and do not be afraid.” And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.</p>
						<p>- Matthew 17:1-8</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>When Jesus becomes transfigured, the disciples see Moses and Elijah talking with Him. Peter wants to build a tabernacle; one for each of them. God interrupts Peter (v5) and says: "This is My Beloved Son...listen to Him!". The message here is so crucial but it's so easy to miss!</p>

					<p>Moses and Elijah represent the Law (Moses) and the Prophets (Elijah). Peter wanted to build a tabernacle to worship/honor the Son, the Law, and the Prophet but God interrupted him and said "This is my son...listen to HIM!". When the disciples heard God's voice, they fell face down. Jesus told them to get up and not to be afraid and when they lifted their eyes, the only one left was Jesus. This is why the writer of Hebrews says:</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.</p>
						<p>- Hebrews 1:1-2</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>What's the point? The Law and the Prophets are the Old Covenant. They pointed to the answer but left us with more questions because they didn't have the answer. We have the answer and His name is Jesus. We can't look at the lives and stories of those in Old Testament and forget that they lived in different and inferior covenant. Jesus is the answer. I love this quote from Bill Johnson:</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Jesus is perfect theology. Whatever you think you know about God that can’t be found in the person of Jesus, you have reason to question. Jesus illustrates the Father perfectly. The Old Testament cannot be given the authority to trump the person of Jesus and what is revealed in the nature and the heart of God in that revelation. And so I get fascinated with Jesus as He modeled life for us. He wasn’t just a parenthesis. He wasn’t just a comma. You know, people ask me questions, “Well, what about Job?” when I teach on certain subjects and my response is, “I’m not a disciple of Job. I’m a disciple of Jesus. Job is the question. Jesus is the answer.” You know, the Old Testament is filled with questions, not conclusions. The conclusions come in the person of Jesus - the One who perfectly illustrates and manifests the nature of the Father. And since He’s better than we think, we need to change the way we think.</p>
						<p>- Bill Johnson</p>
					</blockquote>
					<br/>

					<p>Jesus came to reveal the Father (John 1:14, Hebrews 1:3, Colossians 1:15, John 1:18). Jesus healed everyone that came to Him. If it was the will of God for anyone to be sick, Jesus would've had to go against the will of God and His commission to us would've been a violation of His Father's will. God doesn't send sickness. God doesn't will for anyone to be sick. He has delegated authority to us (His bride) to heal the sick!</p>

					<h4>What if they don't get healed?</h4>
					<p>...what if they do? What are going to do then?</p>
					<p>We get very self-conscious when we pray out loud, don't we? The effectiveness of our prayer has nothing to do with the words that we use. Adding "in Jesus' name" to the end of our prayers isn't the magic formula for God to grant our wishes. Our prayers become effective when we realize our right standing with God and pray from a place of righteousness and authority (James 5:16).</p>
					<p>Our prayers aren't the reason why someone gets healed. The reason why we see someone get healed is because Jesus paid the ultimate price for their healing. We're praying from a place of faith because we see the finished work of the cross and we declare that HIS reality becomes OUR reality. If you don't see the healing take place right away, were you still loving? If you don't see the healing take place right away, did you still plant a seed of faith in that person's heart? That's all that matters!</p>

					<h4>Why do some people not get healed?</h4>
					<p>In Mark 9, the disciples pray for a boy with an impure spirit and they don't see healing. That's our fear, isn't it? That we would "step out in faith and not see breakthrough". We question God and forget that Jesus gives us an example of someone not getting healed.</p>

					<p>When the disciples bring the boy to Jesus, He commands the spirit to leave the boy and the boy is healed. Jesus rebukes His disciples and calls them to a higher place of faith. Over and over again, Jesus calls the disciples to strengthen (focus) their faith (sight). Praying doesn't equal faith; the evidence of faith is that the mountain moves. It's not about "how much faith is stored up", it's about "how clearly do you see your King".</p>

					<h4>Jesus Is Our Teacher</h4>
					<p>It's very easy to allow circumstances and experience dictate our theology but our experience isn't supposed to be our teacher. Jesus is our teacher! We can't allow experience to speak louder than truth. When we focus on experience, we find ourselves just like Peter when he focused on the waves instead of Jesus.</p>

					<h4>How do I actually pray for the sick?</h4>
					<p>Now that you know your authority, here are some tips that we've come up with when actually praying for people:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>- Keep it short</li>
						<li>- Speak from authority and command things to align with God's word</li>
						<li>- Using a scale of 1-10, get a reference point of pain or discomfort before AND after praying so that you can compare. For example, if someone's shoulder is hurting at a 7, they may tell you that it's at a 3 after you pray.</li>
						<li>- Don't be afraid to pray more than once!</li>
					</ul>
