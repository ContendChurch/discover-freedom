						The transition from old to new is radical. It's scandalous. Because grace is scandalous! In order to truly put on the new self (Colossians 3), we need to OWN our identity and begin to respond to the name that God calls us. In this lesson, you'll learn:

						<ul>
							<li>1. The difference between the Old and New Covenant</li>
							<li>2. The true impact of the Cross</li>
							<li>3. The importance of determining in your heart who YOU say Jesus is</li>
						</ul>

						<p>When we think of John the Baptist, we typically think of John 3:30 when he says “He must become greater; I must become less” or “I must decrease so that He can increase”. We’ve all prayed this prayer. I’ve even prayed this prayer! What’s important to note is that while John the Baptist was indeed a prophet, he was an Old Covenant prophet. When he said “I must become less”, he wasn’t talking about himself; he was actually referring to the old covenant. He was prophesying about the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant.</p>

						<p>Jesus shows up on the scene at about age 30 (Luke 3:23). We don’t know very much about His life this far, except that at age 12, Mary and Joseph lost Jesus. He hasn’t performed any miracles so far but we know that in Jewish culture, age 30 meant that a man was at the age to be eligible to receive his father’s inheritance. Jesus shows up at this age to get baptized (Matthew 3). The heavens are ripped opened and the audible voice of God is heard by all the people for the first time in over 400 years! He says “this is my son in whom I am well pleased” and the Holy Spirit descends as a dove and rests upon Jesus.</p>

						<p>After His baptism, Jesus is led into the wilderness where He resists the devil on his own terms. He sets a new standard for humanity in that moment and then He embarks on His true mission. What’s important to note is that Jesus doesn’t perform a single miracle until He receives the Holy Spirit. Jesus spends the rest of His time on earth showing us what it’s like to walk in the Spirit and carry out His mission; OUR mission. He models what life in the New Covenant looks like.</p>

						<p>In the wilderness, the devil was trying to get Jesus to perform in order to prove who He was. To this day, he still does the same thing! What's interesting is that in the final temptation, Satan offered Jesus all the Kingdoms of the world and Jesus didn't rebuke him and say "they're already mine". Why not? Because Jesus hadn't taken the keys of dominion back yet. Instead, He resisted the devil through by power of Holy Spirit to show us how we can do it everyday! We don't resist him when he comes and we don't resist him by arguing with him. We don't even resist the devil by supernatural signs and wonders. We resist him through our complete submission to God.</p>
						
						<p>The Old Covenant (Law) was a relationship with God that was based completely on performance but this New Covenant that you and I live in today is based entirely on Faith. Our Faith in Jesus is what brings us salvation and we are radically REBORN through a simple declaration of our belief but it doesn't stop there. We continue to be renewed in the Spirit of our mind (Ephesians 4:23) by staying rooted in the word and living by the Spirit.</p>

						<p>Let's look at some scripture that will help unpack the impact of the New Covenant. Hundreds of years before Jesus appeared on the scene, the prophet Jeremiah prophesied that God was going to establish a New Covenant with us. The author of Hebrews summarizes this very well in Hebrews 8:10-13:</p>
                
                    <blockquote>
                    “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.” In that He says, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
                    </blockquote>

                <p>It's a very bold statement to say that something is obsolete. Saying that the Old Covenant is obsolete and disappearing is like doing away with the U.S. Constitution! Furthermore, if your current system of government has become obsolete, then something must be inaugurated to take its place. This is what the author of Hebrews refers to in Hebrews 7:12:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                         For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.
                    </blockquote>
                
                <p>Jesus is our Great High Priest. The priesthood changed and therefore the law has changed. Every believer needs to understand the impact of this dramatic shift. The Old Testament Law no longer defines the way in which we connect to God or God relates to us. The old contract was fulfilled and became obsolete; therefore it is now irrelevant to the Kingdom.</p>

                <p>Jesus made a profound contrast of the Old and New Covenant attitude of God in Matthew 5:43-45:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                         You have heard that it was said, “You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.” But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
                    </blockquote>

                <p>Jesus implied that they had heard it said that they should hate their enemies. Where do you think they had heard that? They got it from the Old Testament writers, because that was the attitude of our God under the Old Covenant. As a matter of fact, the Law of Moses made it clear that if you disobeyed God or served other gods, it would stop raining in your land (see Deuteronomy 28: 24). Yet Jesus said something quite different in the quote we just read from Matthew 5. He said that God makes it rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</p>

                <p>Do you remember when the Pharisees sent their experts in the law to test Jesus in Matthew 22? They asked Him: <em>"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"</em>. We see Jesus' response in Matthew 22:37-40:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                         Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
                    </blockquote>

                <p>It's not just that the Law is summarized by these commandments; Jesus was speaking to the nature of the New Covenant and how God will interact with us. Galatians 3:19 states:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                         Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.
                    </blockquote>

                <p>Let's compare that with our new mediator, Jesus Christ, in Hebrews 9:15:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                         For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
                    </blockquote>

                <p>The Law was given to show us our sins and to show us our need for a savior. It was a performance-based relationship between us and God. Aren't you glad that Jesus changed it all? We don't have to earn God's approval. We don't have to earn His love. He loves us. He's proud of us. He willingly calls us SONS AND DAUGHTERS.</p>
						
						<p>When the Heavens ripped open during Jesus' baptism, Jesus became an open heaven and He gives us an invitation to walk under the same access to the Father. The ministry of Jesus is so easily misunderstood if we forget that He came to a people that lived in a covenant that you and I don't live in today. He would reveal Kingdom concepts and He would talk about what was to come because He hadn't died yet. He hadn't revealed the mystery of the gospel. He hadn't empowered us with the Holy Spirit. People viewed Jesus as a prophet; as someone who was coming to deliver the message directly from God but Jesus was coming to reveal God to the people. Jesus came so that you and I can be in right standing with God. He prepared the hearts of the people by showing them sign after sign; by showing them wonder after wonder of who God really is. Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords, the name that is above every other name, is perfect theology. Everything you think you know about God that can't be found in the person of Jesus has to be questioned. </p>

						<p>Jesus summarized all of this in Matthew 16 when He asked His disciples: "Who do you say that I am?" </p>

						<blockquote class="kingdom-principle">
								<p>Our identity is found in who we say Jesus is</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>It's through the revelation of Jesus that we see the true nature of the Father and it's upon THIS rock, that Jesus will build His church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it.</p>
