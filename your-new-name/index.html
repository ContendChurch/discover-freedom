						Prior to our life in Christ, we were trained by a lie. Our mind, our will, and our emotions were set on the things of this world but we've been born again and now we have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16). In this lesson, you are going to learn:

						<ul>
							<li>1. The truth of your new nature in Christ</li>
							<li>2. The lies that the enemy has used to prevent you from reaching your full potential in Christ</li>
						</ul>

						<p>When we think of John the Baptist, we typically think of John 3:30 when he says “He must become greater; I must become less” or “I must decrease so that He can increase”. We’ve all prayed this prayer. I’ve even prayed this prayer! What’s important to note is that while John the Baptist was indeed a prophet, he was an Old Covenant prophet. When he said “I must become less”, he wasn’t talking about himself; he was actually referring to the old covenant. He was prophesying about the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant.</p>

						<p>Jesus shows up on the scene at about age 30 (Luke 3:23). We don’t know very much about His life this far, except that at age 12, Mary and Joseph lost Jesus. He hasn’t performed any miracles so far but we know that in Jewish culture, age 30 meant that a man was at the age to be eligible to receive his father’s inheritance. Jesus shows up at this age to get baptized (Matthew 3). The heavens are ripped opened and the audible voice of God is heard by all the people for the first time in over 400 years! He says “this is my son in whom I am well pleased” and the Holy Spirit descends as a dove and rests upon Jesus.</p>

						<p>After His baptism, Jesus is led into the wilderness where He resists the devil on his own terms. He sets a new standard for humanity in that moment and then He embarks on His true mission. What’s important to note is that Jesus doesn’t perform a single miracle until He receives the Holy Spirit. Jesus spends the rest of His time on earth showing us what it’s like to walk in the Spirit and carry out His mission; OUR mission. He models what life in the New Covenant looks like.</p>

						<p>In the wilderness, the devil was trying to get Jesus to perform in order to prove who He was. To this day, he still does the same thing! What's interesting is that in the final temptation, Satan offered Jesus all the Kingdoms of the world and Jesus didn't rebuke him and say "they're already mine". Why not? Because Jesus hadn't taken the keys of dominion back yet. Instead, He resisted the devil through by power of Holy Spirit to show us how we can do it everyday! We don't resist him when he comes and we don't resist him by arguing with him. We don't even resist the devil by supernatural signs and wonders. We resist him through our complete submission to God.</p>
						
						<p>The Old Covenant (Law) was a relationship with God that was based completely on performance but this New Covenant that you and I live in today is based entirely on Faith. Our Faith in Jesus is what brings us salvation and we are radically REBORN through a simple declaration of our belief but it doesn't stop there. We continue to be renewed in the Spirit of our mind (Ephesians 4:23) by staying rooted in the word and living by the Spirit.</p>
						
						<p>When the Heavens ripped open during Jesus' baptism, Jesus became an open heaven and He gives us an invitation to walk under the same access to the Father. The ministry of Jesus is so easily misunderstood if we forget that He came to a people that lived in a covenant that you and I don't live in today. He would reveal Kingdom concepts and He would talk about what was to come because He hadn't died yet. He hadn't revealed the mystery of the gospel. He hadn't empowered us with the Holy Spirit. People viewed Jesus as a prophet; as someone who was coming to deliver the message directly from God but Jesus was coming to reveal God to the people. Jesus came so that you and I can be in right standing with God. He prepared the hearts of the people by showing them sign after sign; by showing them wonder after wonder of who God really is. Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords, the name that is above every other name, is perfect theology. Everything you think you know about God that can't be found in the person of Jesus has to be questioned. </p>

						<p>Jesus summarized all of this in Matthew 16 when He asked His disciples: "Who do you say that I am?" </p>

						<blockquote class="kingdom-principle">
								<p>Our identity is found in who we say Jesus is</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>It's the revelation of Jesus that we see the true nature of the Father and it's upon THIS rock, that Jesus will build His church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it.</p>
